"""The five scenarios of DESIGN.md section 5.2, as tables of steps.

A scenario is a seeded repository, the workers and people in it, and the
steps of section 5.2 in order: who does what at which hour, and what the
spec says the state is afterwards. run.run_scenario plays one and checks
every guarantee on every step; the expectations here name structure (who
holds what, which markers were posted, which rows the board lists), never
a sentence, so a wording changed on purpose moves only the page's parsers
(page.py). Times are hours from model.T0, as the design's tables count.

A step is one verb of verbs.py by one actor; "act" lets the actor's
scripted worker (policies.py) decide from the page alone until it has
nothing to do, so the scenario shows what a worker that reads only
STATE.md does; "look" changes nothing and checks what a worker would pick;
"guard" asks the push guard about a command the actor might run. A step
that names a finding (shows) is red for it with that finding's switch
off in the oracle (oracle.AS_BUILT), for the findings the oracle reads
as built; S01c's careless lease showed F7 as built until the guard's
fence refused it, and a step red as built would be recorded the same
way. known.json records each such step with its guarantee
(known.py, since build step 5), and tests/test_validation_traces.py holds
the two to each other.
