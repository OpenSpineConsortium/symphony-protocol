"""The deep lane (DESIGN.md, 6.1, 6.6, 6.8 and 14, step 6).

The searches that take too long for the required check, and the checks
that need git: a depth-first search with a depth-aware digest set, from
a start the fast lane's searches share (a seeded repository after one
board run, then a prefix of verbs), over the scopes of DESIGN.md 6.8
(E-two, E-deep, E-faults, E-activity and E-reopen); the scenarios and the
regression traces played over the git world (git_store.py), held to
known.json as the memory world's are; conformance, every counterexample
the searches wrote and sampled paths of the search scopes, each played
in both worlds and compared step by step; and git's answers for the
guard grammar recorded again and compared with the file the fast lane
judges the guard by. The soak and the gate's lanes are soak.py's and
gate_search.py's; scripts/validate.py deep runs them all and writes what
each found under an output folder, with every violation shortened
(shrink.py) and written as a trace file replay.py plays
(validation-out/traces/<guarantee>-<space>-<n>.json, DESIGN.md 6.6), so
a finding is replayed with `python3 scripts/validate.py replay <file>`,
in memory or over git.

The search keeps, for each state's 16-byte digest, the shallowest depth
it was reached at, and expands a state again when it is reached
shallower, since a plain seen-set is incomplete for a depth-bounded
search: a state first reached deep would never be expanded when reached
again shallower (DESIGN.md, 6.1). It goes on past a violation, as the
breadth-first search does, and keeps each distinct violation once with
the first trace it met it on and the detail as that trace met it, a
violation's identity being its guarantee and its detail with any sha in
it read as any sha (invariants.identity), so a later meeting under
another sha counts and changes neither. The reductions of DESIGN.md 6.4 are not
applied: the time cap gave 5 percent at depth 5 (step 4) and a reduced
key is a soundness risk the owner's rule, correctness over cost, does
not take; the lane runs for as long as it takes.
