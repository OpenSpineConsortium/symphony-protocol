"""What GitHub holds for the claim protocol, in memory (DESIGN.md, 3.1).

RepoModel keeps the refs and the commits they name, the issues with their
labels, comments and label events, the pull requests with theirs, every
commit a claim branch ever pointed at, which worker's push made each
branch, and each worker's remote-tracking refs. The clock counts minutes
from T0 and moves only when a scenario or the checker moves it, and every
commit is stamped with it.

A push follows git's rule as validation/prototype/gitprobe.py measured it
with git 2.43: a push that creates the ref or fast-forwards it is taken;
any other is refused, in git's own words, unless it is forced, or it is a
lease that matches the pusher's own remote-tracking ref. So the claim lock
is the model's, as it is GitHub's, and the library under test never sees
it: the board reads only what the fake GitHub (fake_github.py) answers.

canonical() is the state key (DESIGN.md, 6.3): everything a guarantee,
the oracle or a scripted worker reads, comment bodies whole, the label
events, every head a claim branch ever had, the tracking refs, the
board's last page, whether GitHub hides a held branch's standing
(opaque_pulls), whether it calls a branch that is behind clean
(lenient_rules) and whom it will not say may write (unanswered) included,
so two states with one key behave the same
under every verb. The reductions of section 6.4
(times capped, workers by symmetry) come with the checker's fast lane.
