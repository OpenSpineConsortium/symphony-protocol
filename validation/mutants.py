"""The mutation lane (DESIGN.md, section 7, and step 2 of section 14).

A guarantee the harness never sees break is not shown to hold, so the
harness is tested the way it tests the library. A mutant changes one rule
of the library inside this process, by patching one attribute for as long
as the mutant is on, never in the files, the way a careless change could.
The lane runs every mutant against the searches below and requires every
one to be caught: some search must report a violation under the mutant
that it does not report on the library as it stands.

Three lanes come before the searches, since they are cheap and judge rules
no search runs: the regression traces, one per finding (replay.py, since
build step 5), which catch the mutants that undo a fix of 0.4.1 on the
trace of the finding fixed; the guard grammar against git's recorded
answers (guard_grammar.judge, over the plain commands alone here); and
dealing (dealing.run_lane); each reports its failures as the searches
report violations. The searches are breadth first (explore.explore), each from a
short prefix: a few verbs that put the repository where a family of rules
applies (a held claim, a draft, two claims on one file), then every
interleaving of the scope's verbs to a small depth. A prefix holds no
board run of its own, so it reaches the same state with or without a
mutant, and every step after it is searched, not chosen. Two lanes come
after the searches, each wider and slower than any search, so a mutant
reaches them only past every search: the clerk's deal against Pick
(dealing.picking_lane), from one look at every state a person can label
an issue into, held to the spec's Pick and Planning as the oracle reads
them (F18), and, last, every label mix on one issue (labels_lane): a
board run and a due claim's release on an issue carrying each mix of
labels the domain gives, the widest and the slowest catcher. The
hand-written traces in tests/test_validation_mutants.py are each
mutant's shortest example, kept so a failure names the rule that broke;
the lane is what shows the searches bite.

`python3 -m validation.mutants` runs the lane and prints, for each
mutant, the search that caught it with the shortest violation it met and
that violation's trace, then the count caught. The guarantee a mutant
names is the rule it changes; the violation reported is whatever the
search met first, often a comment the run owed or made as a result.

# Cheapest first, since a mutant is judged by the first search that
# catches it. The traces met F4, dealing from differing looks, on the
# library itself until the workflow's one look answered it, and the
# careless search met F7, a lease after a fetch taking another's claim,
# until the guard's fence refused it; nothing is known on the library now.
# The draft's search has GitHub call it blocked, as a rule that holds it
# does (F9), so the adapter's reading of how a held branch stands is
# searched and not only traced. The holder's search runs each board run in
# its two halves (DESIGN.md, 3.3), so a rule that reads the repository
# again in the second half is met. The released blocker's search under
# every fault comes after the blocker's two without faults, which are
# cheaper and so are credited with the mutants they were added for; it
# keeps the one only a refused comment shows, a release that relabels the
# board before its comment. The fork's search has a stranger open a pull
# request from a fork whose branch bears the due claim's name (F17), as a
# draft or ready, and say a draft finished, so every reading of which pull
# request is a claim's is searched; no search before it opens one. The
# second search on one file has the owner label the later claim's issue a
# blocker, so the board's landing order is searched with a blocker in it,
# which lands first though it began last (F15's fifth review).
