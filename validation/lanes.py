"""The deep lane as one run (DESIGN.md, 14, step 6): every part in its
own process, the results in one file.

`python3 scripts/validate.py deep` runs it. The first wave is the
searches (deep.SPACES, each violation shortened and written as a trace
file), the soak in chunks of seeds (soak.py, its violations written the
same way), the gate's lane (gate_search.py), the scenarios and the
regression traces over the git world, and git's answers for the guard
grammar recorded again; the second wave, once the searches have written
their counterexamples, is conformance (deep.conformance), the
counterexamples and sampled paths of every space played in both worlds
and compared, split by space. Each part runs in a process of its own, as
many at once as there are processors or `--jobs` says, since the
searches take hours and share nothing.

The results file (<out>/deep.json) is rewritten as each part ends, so a
run that is killed leaves what it had measured, and each search writes
a checkpoint of its state under <out>/checkpoints/ every quarter of an
hour (deep.search), removed once its result is in the file and the
search was not stopped; `--resume` starts a run again from the file and
the checkpoints, running only the parts the file does not hold, a
search a budget stopped, a gate exploration a budget stopped and a part
that raised among the parts it lacks, and continuing each search from
where its checkpoint left it, so a restart of the machine costs a
quarter of an hour and not the hours; a search's budget counts from its
first start, the checkpoint's seconds included, so a stopped search goes
on under a larger `--budget` or none, and resumed under the budget that
stopped it expands nothing and is red again. The file records the settings and
the code the run was made under (the "run" entry; the code is
deep.code_digest, the harness's and the library's source and the
harness's data files), and a resume under others is refused, since a
part measured under other settings or other code is not this run's; a
run that is not a resume starts clean, with the checkpoints and the
trace files an earlier run left under <out> removed first. A run writes
the file <out>/running, its process id, while it runs, and a second run
into the same folder is refused while that process lives, resume or
not, since the two would write one results file and the fresh one would
remove the checkpoints the other is writing; a SIGTERM to that process,
what `kill <pid>` sends, ends the workers and removes the file, as
Ctrl-C does. Each part runs in a
process of its own, forked, with a pipe for its result, so a process
that dies (killed for its memory, say) takes its own part alone,
recorded as raised, where one shared pool would lose every part in
flight and refuse the second wave, and the parent forks with no helper
thread alive. The counterexamples the searches and the soak
wrote go through conformance as a part of their own, done only while
the files it played are the files the results name, so a resumed search
that writes more is followed by their conformance. The run is red, exit
code 1, on any violation, mismatch, disagreement, differing guard
answer, a part that raised, or a search a budget stopped before it was
done: a stopped search has not checked its space, and the owner's rule
is that a missed violation costs more than the hours.
