"""The dealing lane (DESIGN.md, 9.1): three workers ask the clerk at once.

The workers of one run of workers.yml are dealt the shared work so that
no two start on one claim (G14: the shared work is dealt out, each issue
to at most one worker). The lane starts from one state, a claimed issue
with a ready and clean pull request and two free ones, and plays every
ordering of the state changes that matter between the moments a worker
could look: main moves, so the ready pull request falls behind and its
holder has work again, and a worker outside the run claims one of the
free issues. Each worker's leg is given one of the moments between the
changes; every assignment of moments to workers is tried, and the deal
is the workflow's (clerk.workflow_deals). A deal in which two workers of
the run get one issue is a double deal.

What it found, as built until F4's fix, when each leg asked team.next_for
from its own look: from one look, never a double deal; from differing
looks, one (F4): the holder's pull request was clean at one worker's
look, so the holder was dealt an issue and the worker the next, and
behind at another's, so the holder carried its own claim and that worker
was dealt what the first worker's deal gave the holder. Since the fix the
workflow looks once for the run, in its first job (team.deals), and the
lane fails on any double deal, from one look or from differing looks. On
the library the 54 assignments of moments to legs give one deal per
ordering and run moment, 6 distinct, which the lane counts and the report
says; the assignments are still played, since the mutant that gives each
leg its own look is judged on the same 54 and doubles 15 of them.

Since F18's fix the lane also holds the clerk to Pick: from one look at
every state a person can label an issue into, each deal and each
worker's own answer are judged by the spec's Pick and Planning as the
oracle reads them (picking_lane, below), and so is a regression trace's
deal wherever no claim has a pull request yet (pick_problems). As built
until the fix the clerk read whose a claim is, and whose a task is, from
the labels alone, and the lane found fifteen problems in 7,256 of the
30,720 deals it then had (twelve in 4,888 of 20,480 before F18's review
added the nameless and the released claim; DESIGN.md's F18 entry has the
figures); F8's review added a claim committed ahead of its push and a
kept head pushed again, 40,960 deals.

# (oracle.deal_problems), with each worker's own answer from the same look
# (team.next_for), which the spec has dealt by the same rule. Three
# settings, the issue's labels each mix domains.label_sets gives but those
# with in-review, which neither Pick nor Planning reads (label_mixes): one
# issue, dealt to a and b in either order; a queued issue beside one of
# each mix, dealt to a alone, which holds the order of Pick's places; and
# one of each mix beside a task given to a alone, dealt to a and b in
# either order, which holds a task given alone before one given to
# several. The issue of each mix is held, in turn, by no claim, by a's
# claim or b's, each claim file naming its worker, by a claim whose file
# has no Worker line, or one whose Worker line names nobody, where the
# issue's labels say whose it is, by a's claim released a day after its
# last commit, by the coordinator's comment, whose branch the board has
# not yet renamed, by the same claim with its commit dated 72 hours ahead
# of its push, which GitHub dates it by (F8), and by a's released head
# pushed again as the claim's branch, which the board has not yet
# deleted, its release counting before that push (SPEC["pushed again"]):

# counts it, and a's held claim where it does not. No claim has a pull
# request yet, so each has work for its holder (oracle.carries). In the
