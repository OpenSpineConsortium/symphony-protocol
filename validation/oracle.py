"""The oracle: spec/PROTOCOL.md's rules restated over the model (DESIGN.md, 2.2 and 2.6).

Every term here is read from the spec's text, over what RepoModel holds:
refs, trees, labels, comments and the label events. Nothing here reads a
board.Snapshot or imports from sdlc_protocol, not even a constant: the
marker, the branch names, the label names, "finished; ready to mark", the
overlap marker and the 24 hours are spelled as the spec spells them, and
tests/test_validation_guarantees.py checks that each, and each sentence
SPEC quotes, is in spec/PROTOCOL.md word for word. So a change to a
library constant shows here as a disagreement, and a change to the spec
breaks that test until this file follows.

The oracle answers two kinds of question: what the state is, by the spec
(due, released, the Queue, the claims the board lists, the overlaps), and
what a board run must do from a state (expected_effects), as Effect
records the invariants compare with the writes the run made.

A finding the library does not yet answer is a switch, in known: with its
id in known, the oracle reads that rule as the library is built, so the
search goes on past it and reports it once, as known; without it, the
oracle reads the spec, and the finding shows as a disagreement. AS_BUILT
holds the open findings the board's run can reach (DESIGN.md, 13), read
from validation/known.json since build step 5 (known.py): none since
F2's fix. Five were switches until their fixes: F2, overlapping work
told again once a claim opened its pull request, which the issue now
names for the whole claim; F12, "main moved" told only in the run
the push to main started, which is now told in whichever run finds the
branch behind; F14, Given to workers needing the label todo and leaving
epics out, which now shows every open, unclaimed issue a worker's label
names; F9, a draft never told "main moved", which the adapter now reads
through mergeable and the comparison where GitHub's word is opaque, as
it reads a blocked one; and F13, the landing order's "oldest" read as
the lowest number, which now reads when the work began, as GitHub
records the push that made its branch. F13 and F14 are what the
harness of build step 1 found when its oracle was held to the spec's
words (DESIGN.md, 13).
