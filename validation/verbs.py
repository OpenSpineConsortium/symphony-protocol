"""The verbs: GitHub's and git's real operations, one each (DESIGN.md, 4.1).

A verb is one atomic act by one actor: a push, a label put on or taken
off, a comment, a pull request opened, marked ready or merged, the clock
moved, or a board run. None is a bundle: the prototype's "ready" verb
deleted the claim file, marked the pull request ready and labelled the
issue in-review at once, and the label then hid a mutant that released
ready pull requests. apply() changes the model in place and says what
happened; enabled() lists every verb a scope allows in a state, which is
what the checker explores.

Every push a worker makes is a git command, run from the worker's own
clone, and before the model takes it the push guard judges it, by the
library's own guard.refused_push, as the library's hook, guard.run, does
(the template's tools/guard_push.py does not call it, and judges every
push in the session's own clone, as 0.5.0's guard did); a push the guard
refuses never happens. The guard judges each push in each clone it may
run in (F21), which the memory world names by its directory,
/clones/<name> (CLONES), and reads that clone's branches and the claim
files a lease is judged by (guard.other_holder) from the model as git
there would show them (git_shows, claim_files_in): the remote-tracking
ref as that clone's last fetch or push left it, and the branch pushed.
lease-elsewhere is F7's careless rebaser in a second clone of its own,
reached from its session's clone by git -C, by cd, by a cd that is made
and one that fails, or by env's --chdir written as a start of its name
(F26); or in its session's own clone, reached by moves and names the
guard cannot follow (ELSEWHERE, F21), or written beside here-documents
and quotes the guard misread until F25's fix.

Actors: the workers of the scope, each a person's session that may write
(author_association COLLABORATOR); the owner; carol, a collaborator; dana,
a writer GitHub shows as a contributor, whom only the permission API
vouches for; sam, a stranger with no write access; the clock; the board.
Where the scope's forks is on, sam opens pull requests from a fork, from
a branch named there as a claim's, which is no claim's (F17); where its
strangers is on, sam opens them from a claim's own branch here, which are
no claim's either, and the claim's holder may close one to open its own
(F19). Where its reopens is on, the owner reopens a closed issue, which
GitHub then says was reopened, and may merge a pull request in a
repository that keeps its head branches (F22); where its deletes is on,
the owner closes a claim's pull request without a merge and deletes its
branch while the issue stays open (F22's third review). The owner merges
only a pull request the required check passes, as the default branch's
ruleset, which no one bypasses, makes GitHub hold it to: one marked ready
whose claim file is gone and whose body closes its issue (F30).

Two comments a person can write that look like the coordinator's, offered
where the scope has more than one issue: a worker's comment that quotes
an overlap marker on a later line, as a reply does, and a stranger's
comment whose first line is one, naming the other issues. Neither tells
the work of anything (spec, Overlaps: the coordinator's own comment, by
the repository's workflows), so the coordinator still owes its comment;
a reader that took either for the coordinator's would stay silent. And
carry-on, the next worker's cherry-pick of a released claim's work after
its own claim commit (spec, Release: "may carry the released work on").

Every act GitHub tells the board workflow of fires its events, as
board.yml's triggers name them (a push, a branch made or deleted, a pull
request opened, pushed to, reopened or closed, an issue closed or
labelled; a comment fires none, and neither does marking a pull request
ready), and the model queues a run for each the scope listens for
(RepoModel.fire). The board verb starts one of the runs queued, or the
schedule's, which replaces them; with the scope's split_board on, a run is
two verbs, board-start and board-finish, with any verb but the clock's
between them.

# Since F24's fix, the push before a comment that holds an apostrophe in
