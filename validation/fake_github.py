"""A fake of GitHub's REST API that answers from a RepoModel (DESIGN.md, 3.2).

FakeGitHub is an opener: the library's GitHub adapter takes it through the
opener argument it already has (adapters/github.py, GitHub.__init__), and
every call the adapter makes is answered from the model, a write changing
the model as GitHub would. It serves exactly the endpoints the adapter's
board run calls (the snapshot, the coordinator, the renames and the
comments); the clerk's and the gate's come with the steps that drive them
(DESIGN.md, 14). A call to any other endpoint raises
Unserved, which no part of the adapter catches, so a call the harness
does not model stops the run loudly rather than reading as a 404.

It is faithful to the transport under the adapter, where the prototype's
fake was not:
- The request line is ASCII. Before it answers, the fake encodes the
  method, the selector and the protocol as http.client does, which raises
  UnicodeEncodeError for any other character before anything is sent.
- List endpoints answer 100 items a page, with a Link header naming the
  next page.
- A pull request's mergeable is null on the first read of its detail in a
  run, and computed on the next, as GitHub computes it late.

Fault makes chosen calls fail: an HTTP status, GitHub's message and, for a
rate limit, a retry-after header, or the token's hour spent and ending a
given number of seconds on by the client's clock, which the fake keeps as
the model's minute (FakeGitHub.clock), or no answer at all, as a
connection that times out waiting for GitHub's (F23). A fault of a rate
limit's, a 429 or a 403 that says so, answers one try of the call, which
the library's client makes again after the wait GitHub asks for
(adapters.github.rate_wait), so a fault refuses a call for the run only
with times enough for every try. The client's sleep is the fake's
(FakeGitHub.sleep), which takes no time and keeps each wait the client
makes between two tries of one call on the try it makes next
(Call.waited), so the harness judges a call by its last try and holds
each wait to the one GitHub asked for (invariants.answered,
waits_as_asked), while a call the library makes again of its own, a read
of a push after head_since's pause, stands for itself. With applied, the
write is made and its answer lost, as a 502 after GitHub wrote the
comment, or a rate limit's refusal after GitHub acted on the call
(comment-limited-late, F23's review, and comment-limited-then-422, its
second); with answer, a read of the activity
is answered with a list other than the model's, one that lags a push or
lists one the run did not see (F8), and a read of an issue's comments with
the list before the comments GitHub wrote in the run and lost its answer
to, as a read GitHub answers before it lists them (F23). That GitHub may
answer a write with a server error or with no answer at all after making
it, and list what it wrote only after a later read, is assumed, an
inference from how GitHub may answer that no canary reads (F20's second
review, F23).

What the fake assumes of GitHub, each settled by the documentation or by a
canary check (DESIGN.md, 3.2 and 11) unless said: the issues list holds
the pull requests; a draft's mergeable_state is the word its branch's
standing gives, as any pull request's (C0, read on 2026-10-14 on live
drafts: "clean" for a clean one, "dirty" for a conflicting one, never
"draft"), and "behind" for a branch that is behind, assumed, under a rule
that requires the branch to be up to date before merging, as the
template's main ruleset does (C0 read no branch behind); with the model's
opaque_pulls on, the word is "blocked" wherever the branch is not in
conflict, with mergeable true, as a rule that holds the pull request
gives, a required check pending or red or a review not yet given, and the
comparison carries behind_by (F9); with the model's lenient_rules on,
the word for a branch that is behind is "clean", as GitHub gives under a
rule that does not require an up-to-date branch or under none (F16), and
with both on the word is "blocked", since a rule that holds the pull
request holds it whatever its branch; a rename closes the pull request
whose head the branch is, and so does a delete (the web UI's page says
so; canary C6 settles the REST delete), never one from a fork, whose
branch of the same name stands in the fork; a pull request from a fork
names its author's fork in its head and this repository in its base, in
its detail and in the list's entries, and the list's head filter,
owner:branch, matches the repository the branch stands in (F17); a pull
request names its author and the author's author_association, in its
detail and in the list's entries, and the permission API answers admin
for the owner, write for the model's other writers, read for anyone else
and 403 for a login the model says GitHub will not answer for (F19); a
rename onto a
name that stands answers 422; the board posts as github-actions[bot]
with the author_association NONE; a pull request's updated_at moves
with pushes and comments; and the repository's activity lists the push
that made each branch at GitHub's own time, newest first (F13), with the
head that push set, and the push that last set each branch's head, with
the head it set and the head it moved the branch from (F8; canary C5
read a forced push's before and after on 2026-10-15), with the push
before it, or, for a branch a push made again, the delete before that
push, at that delete's own time with the head it took away as the head
before, assumed, as GitHub's branch_deletion entry (F8's second review), a
renamed branch keeping them, which the model's rename does and canary C6
now records (DESIGN.md section 11, What C6 records of the activity); a
call GitHub refuses for a rate limit is one it did not act on, so such a
fault's refusal writes nothing, assumed, which the client's making a
write again rests on, and which C4 would settle and is not run (DESIGN.md,
3.2 and 11), save comment-limited-late's, which writes the release comment
it refuses and asks a wait longer than a run waits, so the client tries it
once, and comment-limited-then-422's, which writes the release comment on
the first try it refuses and nothing on the second, which it refuses with
a 422, so nothing is written twice, while the labels a release puts back
are held to resting on no such assumption (F23's review and its second);
and a 403 that names a wait in retry-after is a
rate limit's refusal whatever its words, assumed as the library assumes it
(adapters.github.rate_limited), since GitHub's documentation names
retry-after for a secondary limit's refusal and never says that no other
refusal sends it (DESIGN.md, 3.2).

    branch, and a read a push behind and the next refused). reset_after,
