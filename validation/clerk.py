"""The clerk's client over the model: team.Client answered from a RepoModel.

team.py's clerk (next_for, seed, route) reads GitHub through the few calls
of team.Client. ModelClient answers them from a RepoModel, in the shapes
GitHub's REST API gives, the same shapes fake_github.FakeGitHub serves the
board's run, so the clerk is run over the harness's worlds with no HTTP
at all: the dealing lane (dealing.py) hands three workers snapshots of
one model, and the planning table (tests/test_validation_tables.py) seeds
an epic's tasks into one and reads the board that renders them.

A snapshot is a client over a clone of the model at the moment the worker
looked, so a change made after one worker's look and before another's is
what the two see differently; workflow_deals is the workers' workflow's
one look for a whole run, since F4's fix.
