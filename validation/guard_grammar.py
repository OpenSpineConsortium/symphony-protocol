"""The push guard against git's own answers (DESIGN.md, section 8).

commands() generates push commands from parts: a prefix the shell reads
before git, a wrapper that runs the command another way, git's global
options, push options plain, bundled and abbreviated, and refspecs that
name the worker's own claim branch, another worker's, the default and the
board branch under every spelling, a branch that is no claim and a name
that reads as a claim and claims nothing; and, with no wrapper or global
option around them, the prefixes whose wrapper is given a long option by
a start of its name (ABBREVIATED, F26). Each command is judged twice:
by the guard, as the hook runs it, and by the board rules read off what
git would do with it.

Git is the oracle. Each distinct git argument list runs in two scratch
worlds whose bare remote has a pre-receive hook that records every ref
update it is offered, with its kind (create, delete, fast-forward or
forced), and refuses them all, so nothing ever moves. In the fresh world
the clone's remote-tracking refs match the remote; in the stale world the
remote's claim branch, and the branch that is no claim, have moved behind
the clone's back, where git refuses a --force-with-lease itself ("stale
info") but still offers a plain force.
The prefix and the wrapper change whether the guard can read a command,
never what git does, so git runs once per argument list, and record()
writes the answers to guard_git.json, keyed by git's version, for the
fast lane to judge the guard against in under a second (judge()). A
command the file holds no answer for fails the lane.

The rules read off git's offers: an update of main or board is a push to
the default or the board branch; a forced update offered in the stale
world is a plain force, since a lease would have been refused there; a
forced update offered only in the fresh world, on a ref outside claude/,
is a lease outside claude/; more than one ref offered is a wholesale
push; a claude/ name created or updated that reads as a claim and claims
nothing is the misnamed claim the protocol's Claim rule names; and a
deletion of any other branch is judged by whose it is, which only the
second fence knows (G11b), so it is not judged here.

A refusal of a push git shows harmless is listed by shape, and fails the
lane only for the shapes the rules name as allowed: a plain push of one's
own claim branch, its lease after a rebase, and a plain push of a branch
that is no claim; the rules forbid other shapes whatever their effect
("your own claim branch takes --force-with-lease, and nothing else ever
does", symphony-template's .claude/rules/board.md). A forbidden push let
through fails the lane unless the guard cannot read the command (inside
a string another program runs: G11b) or the lane withholds the fact
(whose a claim branch is: the lane runs the guard with no claim-file
reader, so a lease onto another worker's claim passes here as it does
in a clone that cannot show the claim files; the fence that reads them
is tests/test_guard.py's, over a real clone, since F7's fix).
