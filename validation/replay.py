"""One replayable regression trace per finding (DESIGN.md, 5.3 and 14, step 5).

Each file under validation/traces/, <finding>.json, is the trace of
DESIGN.md's table in 5.3 for one finding, F1 to F27: the
repository it starts from (its issues with their labels, its workers, the
people beside them, the files each claim lists, whether the workers are
careless, the events the board hears and whether a run is made in two
halves) and its steps, each a verb by an actor at an hour, with what the
spec says the state is afterwards, in the shape scenarios.py gives a step
(Expect). replay() plays one through run.play, so every guarantee is
checked after every step as a scenario's are, and the record holds the
violations, the mismatches and a timeline a person reads;
scripts/validate.py replay <file> prints it.

A trace of a fixed finding (F1, F3, F5, F6, F10 and F11 in 0.4.1; F2,
F4, F7, F8, F9, F12, F13, F14, F15, F17, F18, F19 and F20 in 0.5.0; F21,
F22, F26, F23, F25, F27 and F24 after it; F16 in the spec's words, which the library
already kept) is green, and each mutant that undoes a part of its fix
turns it red at the step where that part showed, for the guarantee the
table names, which tests/test_validation_traces.py holds it to. A trace
of an open finding is red where known.json records it, with the
finding's switch off in the oracle for the ones the oracle reads as
built; none is left since F2's fix, and none is red as built, as F4's
was until its fix.

The file's steps are objects: "verb" (a verb of verbs.py, or "announce",
the Announce verbs, claimed and the worker's label on, each other worker's
label the step's second argument lists off, and the plan; "guard" and
"deal", the two steps run.py plays without the model), "actor" (the board's and the clock's need none),
"args" as a list, "at", the hour, kept from the step before when left
out, "skew", hours added to a claim's or a commit's committer date,
"event", "ref" and "faults" for a board verb, "expect" in Expect's shape
with lists for its sets and numbers for its keys where JSON has strings,
"shows", the finding the step is red for, and "note" and the file's
"world", read by nobody. A step is numbered, in known.json, in the tests
and in a replay's report, by its place among the steps as played, from
zero, where an "announce" counts as each of its verbs. Every file is ASCII:
a character outside it is written as a \\u escape.
