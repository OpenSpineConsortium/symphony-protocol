"""Playing a scenario (DESIGN.md, 5.1): run_scenario(scenario) -> RunRecord.

Each step of the scenario is applied to the model in turn, at its hour,
and after every verb every guarantee is checked (invariants.step_checks),
as the checker checks a search. After each step the expectations the
scenario states are compared with the state and the last page the board
wrote, and a difference is a mismatch. The record holds each step with
the verbs it ran, their outcomes, the violations met and the mismatches
found, every page the board rendered, how many checks ran and a timeline
a person reads.

A step by a scripted worker ("act") runs the worker's policy from the
page and its own clone alone until it has nothing to do, a few verbs at
most, so the scenario shows what a worker that never sees the model does;
an argument ("released", n) names the newest released branch of issue n,
which no scenario can spell in advance, since the name holds the head's
sha.

Two steps are no verb of the model's: "guard" asks the push guard about a
command and, when the command is one of the guard grammar's, judges the
guard's answer by git's recorded one (guard_grammar.judged_by_git, G11a);
"deal" deals the workers' legs, each given a moment, from the model as the
steps left it, the way the workers' workflow deals since F4's fix: one
look for the run, no later than the earliest leg (dealing.play, G14). Both
are what the regression traces of DESIGN.md 5.3 need (replay.py).
