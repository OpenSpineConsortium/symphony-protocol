"""The mutation lane's mutants (validation/mutants.py), in the required
check: the lane's size, every mutant's target still in the library, and
each mutant caught on its shortest trace, which the library itself passes
(or, for a lane, on something beyond what the lane knows red as built).
The lane proper, every mutant against every search, runs in validate.yml
(python3 -m validation.mutants), since it takes about two minutes; these
traces are what the lane found, kept so a change that stops the harness
catching a mutant fails here too, naming the rule. A mutant of a rule no
search runs names the cheap lane that catches it instead (step 4), and
the test runs that lane."""

        push read once, the before side ignored, and the clerk dating by
        the committer date or ignoring a kept head, and its second review
        two: a stale entry off the head dating it, and a kept head's old
        release taken for the comment a failed post would have written, and
        its fix check five: a fresh entry dating only where it moved the
        branch off the head, the floor dropped, the floor of the last read
        alone, the second read judged with no moment of the run, and a
        floor at the committer date taken for later, and its third review
        four: the floor of the first read alone, the earlier floor, a fresh
        delete dating nothing, and the run's event ignored, so the bound is
        widened to 120 and the count noted; its follow-up's second review
        one, an older push trusted in the run its push started; F20's fix
        three, an unsettled release put back, counted, or failing the run;
        F21's fix three, the guard ignoring git's and env's -C, not
        following the shell's moves, and taking a cd to what is not a
        directory as made, and its third review two, a push judged only
        where the shell's moves take it and a push whose clone cannot be
        told judged by its words alone, so the bound is widened to 130, and
        its fourth review three, a relative -C after a move judged where it
        names alone, GIT_DIR forgotten once an absolute path names a place
        and a -C by ~ judged where it names alone; one from the review of
        the client's waits for a rate limit, a 5xx retried as a rate
        limit, and eight from its second review, one for each rule of the
        client's waits, so the bound is widened to 150, 134 within it;
        F26's fix three, a long option read only in full, env's
        abbreviated --chdir not read and an optional value taken from the
        next word, 137; and F22's fix seven, a reopened issue left as it is,
        todo put on last, a ready pull request's in-review taken off, a
        claim branch and a released branch not read for a reopened issue,
        in-review left on where a branch stands, and the releases due read
        before the freeing, 144 within that bound, its review one, a release
        before the issue's last close read as an undo, 145, its second
        review one, claimed put back after the close read as the ended
        claim's, 146, its third review one, a claim made since the close
        read as an undo, 147, and that review's review one, an undo after an
        ended claim read as the claim's, 148; and F23's fix three, a late
        comment's labels put back, no answer taken for a refusal, and a
        refusal taken for a late comment, 151, its review one, a rate
        limit's refusal taken for one that wrote nothing, 152, and its
        second review one, a refusal after a rate limit read by its last try
        alone, 153; and F25's fix seven, one for each rule of its reading: a
        quote that never closes hiding the command, no here-document's body
        told, a here-document in a quoted substitution read as text, an
        expanded body's substitutions cut out with it, a body in a
        substitution ended only by its delimiter's own line, an expanded
        body's backslash-newline kept and every double parenthesis read as
        arithmetic, 160; and its second review four: a body that waits for a
        newline in the substitution that closed, an expanded body's
        substitution kept with its own bodies, a case pattern's parenthesis
        closing its substitution and arithmetic's parentheses counted inside
        quotes, 164; and its third review two: a parameter expansion read as
        text and a backquoted span read as text, 166; and its fourth review
        three: $$ read as a $ before what follows, old-style arithmetic read
        as text and a backquoted span's quotes read as the quoting around
        it, 169; and F27's fix two, a label taken off and lost stays off
        and a label refused its removal put back, 171, and its review one, a
        404 after a rate limit read as never on, 172. That passes 150, so
        the bound is widened to 200: the lane grows by a few mutants for
        each finding it fixes, and 0.5.1 carries several findings, F22,
        F23, F24, F25, F26, F27 and F28 among them. F28's
        fix four, one for each rule of env's words: env's assignments read
        as the shell's, env's lone - not read, env's -S string not split
        and env's lone assignment read as the shell's, 176; and its review
        four, a lone - read past as one of env's options, an -S string's
        variables read only as written, time matched by its program's
        name and a time the guard cannot tell read as the keyword alone,
        180; and its second review one, every ${NAME} read all set or all
        unset, 181; and its third review one, a push env's -S spells read
        only as written, 182; and F24's fix six,
        one for each rule of its reading: a substitution in double quotes
        read as part of its word, a process substitution read as a
        redirection, a nested substitution left unread, a backquoted span
        in a substitution read as text, arithmetic read as no substitution
        and a $'...' read as a quoted span, 188; and its first review six:
        a single quote in a double-quoted ${ } read as a quote, arithmetic
        read as commands, a single quote in $[ ] read as a quote, a body's
        arithmetic left out of what it runs, substitutions told alike by
        their own texts alone and a backquoted span's hidden bodies left
        in, 194; and F29's fix twelve, one for each rule of the words bash
        builds: a $'...' read as a $ and a quoted span, a $"..." read so, a
        command's own text left unread, a word bash builds read as its text
        alone, every word read set, none unset, braces read as written, an
        option bash builds read as written, a name bash builds read as
        written, a line continuation read as ending a word's start,
        arithmetic jumped over by the scan, a lone assignment read as naming
        the repository for good and a here-document's delimiter cut at a
        substitution, 206; and its first review ten: a word of expansions
        alone read as built, a refspec of holes read as : where each is
        nothing, a built option refused after a whole flag, the hook's gate
        read with continuations in, coproc read as the command, coproc's
        name read as the command, a ${ } read as closing at its word's end,
        an array's ${ } read as giving nothing, a $'...' in a default read
        as written and extended patterns left unread, 216. 206 passed 200,
        so the bound was widened to 250 with F29's fix,
        as F23's fix widened it from 150: the lane grows by a mutant for each
        rule a fix adds, and the guard's reading of bash is the part of the
        library that grows most."""
