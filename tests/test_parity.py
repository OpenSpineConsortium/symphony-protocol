"""The library against the template it was taken from: the same input
through the template's tools and through sdlc_protocol gives the same
output, byte for byte.

Four tools moved here, and each is held to its old self on the inputs the
template's own tests use. The board renders the same STATE.md for every
snapshot the template's tests/test_board.py renders, in the template's
layout (as_the_templates: since then the page names a claim's worker
where it named an account, and shows the overlaps and the issues given to
workers), collects the same snapshot from the same GitHub, apart from the
releases it reads since, and posts the same comments. The protocol
check names the same problems for the template's events, as a function and
as a command. The push guard, the template's own as its main held it at
2a8bc3f, before it vendored this library, gives the same exit code and the
same reason for each hook payload of its tests. The team clerk gives the
same answers and makes the
same writes for each scenario of the template's tests/test_team.py, in
team mode's words (as_team_modes: since then a task is given to a worker
by worker:<name> where team mode wrote agent:<name>, and the coordinator
plans where the lead did).

Both sides talk to one GitHub held in memory and served as a urllib
opener, so each runs through its own REST client as it would against
api.github.com, and the two runs are compared by their writes as well as
their answers. The template is read where SDLC_TEMPLATE points, by default
a clone named symphony-template beside this repository, and only read: its
tools are loaded from their source text, so no bytecode cache is written
into it, and its commands run with -B. Since the template vendored this
library, its tools are shims over the copy, so they are read from its git
as they stood before that commit. Every test here skips when the template,
or that history, is not there.

The differences the extraction declared on purpose are pinned at the end,
so a change on either side shows."""
