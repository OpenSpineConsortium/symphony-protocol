"""The dealing lane (validation/dealing.py, DESIGN.md 9.1): three workers'
legs at any moments of one model, dealt as the workers' workflow deals,
once for the run from one look; no issue is dealt twice (G14), where each
leg's own look dealt one twice until F4's fix; the clerk's deal from one
look at every state a person can label an issue into, held to the spec's
Pick and Planning, where the clerk parted from them until F18's fix; and
