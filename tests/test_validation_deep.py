"""The deep lane (validation/deep.py, shrink.py, lanes.py): the depth-first
search with its depth-aware digest set finds what the breadth-first
search finds and expands a state again when reached shallower; a
violation is shortened to a trace that still shows it and written as a
trace file replay.py plays, red in both worlds alike; conformance plays
a path in both worlds and compares what each left; git's answers for
the guard grammar recorded again match the file; known.json's search
entries are empty, since E-faults meets no known finding after F7's fix;
a search continues from its own checkpoint and starts over from
another's; and the lane as one run writes deep.json, resumes only its
own, lands the other parts when one raises or its worker process dies,
runs a part again on resume once it raised or a budget stopped it, plays
the counterexamples a resumed search wrote, and refuses to start beside
a run in progress. The real spaces run for hours (scripts/validate.py
deep); here the spaces are small."""
