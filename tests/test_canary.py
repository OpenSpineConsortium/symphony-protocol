"""scripts/canary.py: the live canary's checks, driven against a fake site.

The checks read and write GitHub and git through the methods of
canary.Site alone, so a fake with the same methods, keeping issues, pull
requests, branches and a board page in memory and reacting to the driver
as the live board would when the test says so, drives every check end to
end; the live site's git side, Clone, is run for real against a bare
repository here, the race included, and its REST side, canary.Site's own
calls, against the library's FakeOpener, which answers each path as
GitHub's API does.
