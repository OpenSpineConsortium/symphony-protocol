"""The regression traces of DESIGN.md 5.3, one per finding, F1 to F23 and

# A fixed finding, each mutant of validation/mutants.py that undoes a part
# of its fix, the step the trace then goes red at (numbered as played, an
# announce counting as three) and the guarantee DESIGN.md's table names;
# F6's fix has two parts, the render's sort key and the quoted path. F8's
# trace goes red at its first board run, step 13, where b's claim, its
# head dated 48 hours back, was pushed an hour before and is released
# once idleness is read by the committer date, and where the activity
# lists a push from a's head after the run read the branch, which the
# run reads the activity again for once the before side of an entry is
# ignored; at its second, step 14, where a's claim, its head dated 72
# hours ahead, a day idle by its push, is held once idleness is read by
# the committer date; at its third, step 15, where GitHub answers the
# first read of b's push with a 500 and the run reads it no more once the
# push is read once; at the run after c pushes its released head again,
# step 23, where that branch stands as a claim, not deleted, once the
# release that kept the head counts by its time alone, or only from the
# push on, since it came before; and at the last, step 25, where a's
# branch, whose release the label claimed undid, has gone a day without
# a push and is not released once a release comment holds a kept head
# whatever the labels say, and b's, the board counting its kept release,
# is released twice once no head is read as kept; and, since F8's second
# review, at step 28, where a's kept head, pushed again a day after the
# board deleted it, meets an activity a push behind whose newest entry is
# that delete, and at step 37, where c's claim commit, pushed back a day
# after a commit moved claude/3 off it, meets one whose newest entry is
# that commit's push, each claim released in the run its push started
# once a stale entry off the head dates it; and at step 29, where a's
# kept head, its release undone, is released again by a run whose
# comment GitHub refuses, and the labels stay off once the earlier
# release of the head is taken for the comment the post would have
# written; and, since F8's fix check, at the five runs after c's two
# commits dated back: at step 39, where both reads are a push behind and
# the floor is the commit's own minute, the log says the claim is read
# from its floor once a floor at the committer date is taken for later;
# at step 41, where the floor is later than a commit dated two days
# back, c's claim is released in the run its push started once the floor
# is dropped; at step 42, where the second read is refused, likewise once
# the floor is the last read's alone; at step 43, where the second read
# lists a push after the run read the branch, the log says the claim is
# read from its floor once that read is judged with no moment of the
# run; and at step 44, where the newest of two such pushes names the head
# on neither side, the run reads again once a fresh entry dates only
# where it moved the branch off the head; and, since F8's third review,
# at step 45, where the first read is two pushes behind and the second
# one, c's claim is released once the floor is the first read's alone
# or the earlier of the two; at step 47, where the read lists the
# branch's delete after the run read it, the run reads again and the
# log says the claim is read from its floor once a fresh delete dates
# nothing; and at step 49, where a's claim anew, its commit dated two
# days back, meets reads both a push behind in the run its own push
# started, it is released once the run's event is ignored; and, since F8's
# follow-up's second review, at step 53, where c has pushed claude/3 back
# to its claim commit, the head the branch's making at 101 set, and the
# run its push started reads the activity two pushes behind, listing that
# making newest, c's claim is released once such a push is trusted in
# that run. F9's
# trace goes red at its first board run, step 2, where the draft level
# with main is told it moved once the adapter reads the comparison's
# ahead_by for behind_by, and at its second, step 4, where the draft
# behind main hears nothing once the adapter takes GitHub's word alone;
# F13's at its first board run, step 4, where b's draft lands before a's,
# whose branch was made first, once the order is by number again or once
# a draft is dated by its opening; at its second, step 5, where GitHub
# refuses the first read of the activity, the run fails once the refusal
# escapes, and the drafts land by their openings once no branch is asked
# about on its own; and at its third, step 7, where GitHub refuses every
# read, c's claim, which nothing dates then, lands first once such work
# counts first. F15's at its run that fails at the comment, step 6, where
# the todo the release put on stays on once the putting back forgets it,
# and at the next run, step 7, where the release puts no todo on once the
# rule is gone, or the page that run writes leaves #1 out of the Queue once
# the snapshot forgets the todo. F16's at its second board run, step 4,
# where the draft GitHub calls clean while it is behind main hears "main
# moved", which the spec says the rules do not hold it for, once such a
# word is compared. F17's at its second board run, step 7, where a's idle
# claim is due while sam's ready pull request from a fork bears its
# branch's name: the claim is not released once that pull request is
# read as the claim's, by the coordinator, by the adapter's ready
# branches or by the board's reading of a release, and sam's pull request
# hears nothing, or is left off the page, once the release's rename is
# read as closing it; and at its last run, step 9, after main has moved
# past sam's branch, which hears no "main moved" once a pull request from
# a fork is left out of the word (F17's review). F18's at its first deal,
# step 1, where #1, which the labels of a and b give, goes to neither once
# such a task is dealt as one given alone, or a takes it before #2, given
# to it alone, once the task given alone waits for the rest; and at its
# second, step 5, after b has claimed #1, its Announce still to come, and
# c has claimed #3 and labelled it blocked, where a is told to carry b's
# claim once whose a claim is is read from the labels alone, and c its
# waiting claim once a claim labelled blocked is carried. F19's at its
# first board run, step 6, where sam, who may not write, has opened a
# pull request marked ready from a's own claude/1 before a opened its
# draft: the claim's row names sam's pull request, or the Overlaps fold
# it into the claim's work, once it is read as the claim's own; and at
# its second, step 7, where a's claim is due: it is not released once
# sam's ready pull request is read as finishing it, by the adapter's
# marking, the coordinator, the adapter's ready branches or the board's
# reading of a release, and sam's pull request, which the release's
# rename closes, is listed or spoken to once the rename is read as
# leaving it open. F20's at its first board run, step 8, where GitHub
# writes a's release comment and loses its answer, then refuses the read
# of the issue's comments after it: the release counts and the branch
# is renamed in that run once the run takes the refused read for the
# comment standing, and the run fails once the refused read is let
# through; each again at its third, step 10, for b's comment GitHub
# never wrote; and at its eighth, step 21, where GitHub refuses the
# comment on b's new claim with a 422 and then the read after it: the
# labels go back once a refused read finds no comment, where after the
# server errors of steps 8 and 10 such a read leaves them off since
# F23's fix, as one that lists none does, so a refusal is where that
# mutant differs (F23's review). F21's at b's first lease from its
# second clone, step 1, by git -C, which is taken once the guard
# ignores git's and env's -C, at its second, step 2, by cd, taken once
# the guard does not follow the shell's moves, and at its third, step
# 3, after a cd that is made and one that fails, taken once the guard
# takes the second cd as made; and at b's leases from its own clone,
# step 5, by a -C the shell expands, taken once a push is judged only
# where the shell's moves take it, or once a push whose clone cannot
# be told is judged by its words alone, the first of these until F25's
# fix taken a step sooner, at step 4, after a here-document whose body
# holds a cd, which the reading with the body cut out now judges where
# the command starts too; and, from F21's fourth review, step 6, by a
# -C relative to where a cd behind a test that fails would have taken
# the shell, taken once such a -C is judged where it names alone, step
# 7, with GIT_DIR exported before an absolute -C, taken once GIT_DIR
# is forgotten when an absolute path names a place, and step 8, by a
# -C from a ~ after HOME is set in the command, taken once such a -C
# is judged where it names alone. F22's at its first board run, step
# 10, after #1 was reopened once a's pull request merged and the
# repository deleted claude/1: claimed, in-review and worker:a stay on
# once the coordinator leaves a reopened issue as it is, and a label
# goes on after one came off once todo is put on last; at its second,
# step 21, where b's pull request, marked ready, finishes the claim on
# #1 closed and reopened, its in-review comes off once a ready pull
# request is not read; at its third, step 24, where b's merged branch
# is kept and #1 reopened, in-review stays once the claim branch is
# not read, the coordinator then planning to free #1 wholly and,
# reading claude/1 again, freeing nothing, or once in-review is left
# on where a branch stands; at its fifth, step 36, where a's merged
# pull request closed #1 after b's release and the owner reopened it,
# b's released branch still standing, claimed and worker:a stay once a
# release before the last close is read as an undo (F22's review); at
# its sixth, step 47, where a's merged branch, kept a day after its
# last commit, is not released in the run that takes its in-review off
# once the releases due are read before the freeing; at its seventh,
# step 49, where the owner put claimed back on the reopened #1 to undo
# the release that run made, claimed comes off once the released
# branch is not read; at its eighth, step 54, where the owner closed
# #1 and reopened it after that release and put claimed back again,
# claimed comes off once claimed put on after the close is read as the
# ended claim's (F22's second review); at its ninth since F22's third
# review, step 67, where b claimed #1 after it was closed and reopened
# again and the owner closed b's ready pull request unmerged and
# deleted claude/1, claimed and worker:b stay once a claim made since
# the close is read as an undo; and, since that review's review, step
# 69, where the owner put claimed back an hour after that delete to
# undo a's release, claimed comes off once any entry since the close
# is read as the claim's whenever the label went on. F23's at its
# first board run, step 16, where GitHub writes a's release comment,
# answers 502 and lists it only after the run's read of the issue's
# comments: the labels go back beside the comment once a read that
# lists none is taken for one GitHub never wrote whatever it answered;
# at its third, step 18, where the post of b's comment has no answer
# at all, once no answer is taken for a refusal; at its seventh, step
# 22, where GitHub refuses d's comment with a 422, the labels stay off
# once a refusal is taken for a comment listed late; and, from its
# review, at its ninth, step 28, where GitHub refuses the comment on
# d's second claim for a rate limit having written it and lists it
# late, the labels go back beside the comment once a rate limit's
# refusal is taken for one that wrote nothing; and, from its second
# review, at its eleventh, step 34, where GitHub refuses the comment
# on d's third claim for a rate limit having written it, then the
# client's second try with a 422, and lists it late, the labels go
# back beside the comment once a refusal after a rate limit's is read
# by its last try alone; and F26's at its first guard step, step 1,
# env --uns FOO before a push to main, which passes once a wrapper's
# long option is read only by its whole name, as do its second and
# third, nice --adj 5 and timeout --sig KILL 60; at its fourth, step
# 4, env --def before a push to main, which passes once a value an
# option may take is taken from the next word; and at b's lease from
# its second clone by env --ch, step 5, taken once env's --chdir is
# read only by its whole name. F25's at b's leases from its own clone:
# step 2, before a line whose quote never closes, taken once such a
# quote hides the command; step 3, between two here-documents whose
# bodies' apostrophes pair around it, taken once no body is told; step
# 4, between two in double-quoted substitutions, taken once a << in
# such a substitution is read as text; step 5, in a substitution in a
# body the shell expands, taken once an expanded body's substitutions
# are cut out with it; and step 6, after a body a line EOF)" ends,
# taken once a body in a substitution ends only at its delimiter's own
# line; step 7, after a body a line E and a backslash, then one OF,
# ends, taken once an expanded body's backslash-newline is kept; and
# step 8, between the here-documents of two ((cd .); ...) subshells,
# taken once every (( is read as arithmetic; and, since its second
# review, step 9, between two bodies whose substitutions close on
# their operators' own lines, taken once such a body waits for a
# newline in the substitution that closed; step 10, after a body whose
# substitution holds a body of its own with an apostrophe, taken once
# an expanded body's substitution is kept with its own bodies; step
# 11, between two double-quoted substitutions whose case patterns hold
# here-documents, taken once a pattern's ) closes its substitution;
# and step 12, between the bodies of ((echo "))"); ...) and a later
# one, taken once arithmetic's parentheses are counted inside quotes;
# and, since its third review, step 13, between two double-quoted
# substitutions that hold ${y:-)} before a here-document, taken once a
# parameter expansion is read as text, and step 14, the same with a
# backquoted case command, taken once a backquoted span is read as
# text; and, since its fourth review, step 15, after echo $${ and a
# body with an apostrophe, taken once $$ is read as a $ before what
# follows, step 16, between two double-quoted substitutions that hold
# $[ ) ] before a here-document, taken once old-style arithmetic is
# read as text, and step 17, after x=`echo "`, taken once a backquoted
# span's quotes are read as the quoting around it. Its step 1, after a
# body with an apostrophe, is the finding's first shape, which both of
# the fix's readings read, so no one mutant takes it.
# F27's at its first release, step 16, where GitHub takes claimed off
# a's issue and answers 502, once a label whose removal failed is never
# put back, at its third, step 20, where GitHub refuses to take claimed
# off c's issue with a 422, once such a label is put back whatever
# GitHub answered, and, from its review, at its fourth, step 22, where
# claimed's removal on d's issue is refused for a rate limit having
# taken it off and answered 404 on the client's second try, once that
# 404 is read as a label never on. F28's at its first guard step, step
# 1, env 1x=2 before a push to main, which passes once only a shell
# name's assignment is read after env; at its second, step 2, env -- -
# before a forced push, which passes once env's lone - is not read; at
# its fourth, step 4, env -S with the push as its string, which passes
# once the string is not split; and at b's lease from its second clone
# by git -C after env GIT_DIR=x alone, step 7, taken once env's lone
# assignment is read as the shell's; and, from its review, at its fifth
# guard step, step 8, env - --sp=x before a push to main, which passes
# once a lone - is read past as an option; at its sixth, step 9, env -S
# with ${NOPE} before the push, which passes once the string's variables
# are read only as written; and at b's leases after /usr/bin/time
# GIT_DIR=x, step 10, and "time" GIT_DIR=x, step 11, taken once time is
# matched by its program's name, or a time the guard cannot tell is read
# as the keyword alone; and, from its second review, at its seventh guard
# step, step 12, env -S with ${NOPE} -u ${HOME} before the push, which
# passes once the string's names are read all set or all unset; and,
# from its third review, at b's lease inside an -S string of seven names
# with push spelled pu""sh, step 13, taken once push is looked for only as
# written.
