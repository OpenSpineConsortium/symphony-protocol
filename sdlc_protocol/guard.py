"""Refuse a git push the board rules forbid, before it runs.

Claude Code runs this as a PreToolUse hook on the Bash tool, through
cli.py's "guard" subcommand: the tool call arrives as JSON on stdin, exit
code 2 stops it, and stderr goes back into the session as the reason.
The rules are the board rules of the repository that vendors this
(its .claude/rules/board.md): the default branch takes only pull
requests, the board branch takes only the board workflow's writes, and
the one forced push the protocol allows is --force-with-lease on one's
own claude/ branch after a rebase; and the protocol's Claim rule, that the
claim branch of issue N is claude/N exactly, so a branch of other digits
after claude/, which reads as a claim and claims nothing, is not pushed.
A refusal is the rule working; the answer to one is a pull request, a
rebase or another branch, never a way around the hook.

The lease is also the one push GitHub itself would let take another
worker's claim: a worker that has fetched holds a remote-tracking ref
that matches the remote, so its --force-with-lease onto claude/N is
taken whoever claimed N, and a ruleset against forced pushes on claude/**
would refuse the prescribed lease too (spec/PROTOCOL.md, Work in the
open). So before a lease onto claude/N the guard reads whose the claim
is, from the claim file docs/agents/claims/N.md on the branch the lease
holds against (the commit a --force-with-lease=claude/N:<commit> names,
else, or when git cannot show that commit, as a lease written with a
shell variable names one, the remote-tracking ref refs/remotes/<remote>/
claude/N as the fetch left it), and whose claim the branch pushed makes
it, from the same file on that branch; on either side the file is read
at the tip, or, once the branch has deleted it as a finished branch has,
where its history last added it, the last so that an issue claimed again
after a merge is judged by its new claim and not by the one main's
history keeps. A lease whose two workers differ, or that would put a
branch with no claim file where another worker's claim stands, is
refused (other_holder). The file is read with git in the clone the push
runs in, so the fence costs a few git calls on a lease push and nothing
on any other command.

Each push is judged in each clone it may run in (refused_push,
push_places), since a session's shell is not always where its push goes:
git -C and env -C name another directory, and cd, pushd and popd move the
shell before a later command, so "cd ../other && git push origin HEAD"
pushes the other clone's branch, and its current and default branch, and
its claim files, are that clone's. The -C of git and env are joined on as
chdir reads them (push_place). The shell's moves are followed within one
command (placed_commands), each part of a pipeline and each list run with
& in a shell of its own, a cd or pushd to what is not a directory leaving
the shell where it stood, as the shell does when it fails there. But this
module cannot tell which of the moves it reads the shell makes: one in a
here-document's body, after a test that fails or in a function never
called counts as made, and one into a directory the command makes first,
as after mkdir, as failed. So a push after a cd, pushd or popd is judged
also where the command starts, as if no move ran, and, where a -C
relative to where the shell stands names its clone, in the session's own
clone too. Where this module cannot tell the directory, after cd - or
cd -P, with a path that holds what the shell expands, quoted or not,
since this module keeps no quotes, or that starts with bash's ~+, ~- or
~N (joined), or with the repository named by --git-dir, --bare, GIT_DIR
or GIT_REFERENCE_BACKEND, on the push or set before it, the push is
judged by what its words name and in the session's own clone. A push is
refused when any of these judgements refuses it. So a push is judged in
the session's own clone, as every push was judged before F21's fix, save
one whose clone git's or env's -C names by an absolute path, or a
relative one with no cd, pushd or popd before it in the same shell,
holding nothing the shell expands, and whose repository nothing names:
that push is judged in the clone the -C names alone. That is the clone it
runs in, save where the shell does what this module does not read, as
where the command first points a symbolic link on that path elsewhere
(ln -sfn), makes a repository there (git init, git worktree add) or
writes a .git file there, since the hook reads the path before the
command runs. This module does not trust a ~ to name a clone: it reads
one from the hook's own HOME, while a HOME the command sets before it
sends the shell elsewhere, and quotes, which this module does not keep,
leave a ~ as written, so a push by a -C from a ~ is judged where this
module reads it and in the session's own clone too (from_a_tilde). And it
does not follow a move or an export in a command handed to eval or trap
or in a file run by source or ., nor what a function or alias the
session's shell has before the command does, as one named git or cd may,
nor a variable that names the repository given its value by read,
printf -v or a for loop: it judges the push as if none of them ran. A
refusal reads as it did before the fix, and ends with what the hook could
not tell and how to have the push judged in its clone alone (UNMOVED,
UNTOLD) only where the reading that refused it is one the command's words
do not name.

The hook is the first fence and branch protection on GitHub the second,
so anything this module cannot read it lets through rather than wedging
the session: a push in quoting it misreads, a broken payload or a git that
answers nothing all pass, and GitHub still refuses what matters; a claim
file git cannot show, on either side of a lease, as on a branch whose
history never had one, is a claim the fence cannot judge, and the lease
passes as it did before the fence. Git is found behind what the shell
reads before a command: VAR=value assignments, the reserved words that
open a compound command or negate a pipeline (!, {, if, then, else, elif,
while, until, do, and function with its name), and the wrappers env,
command, nice, time, exec, nohup and timeout, each with its own options as
it reads them, a long one by any start of its name that names it alone, as
env --uns for env --unset, since GNU's getopt_long reads them so (WRAPPERS,
F26), and git's own options before the verb, each with its value where it
takes one (GIT_VALUE_OPTIONS), and a query after which git runs nothing
(GIT_QUERIES). A push is read as git reads its arguments: short options
in a bundle, as in -fu; a long one by any start of its name that names it
alone, as --force-w, or taken back with --no-; a value that is no
refspec; the refspecs that write many branches, the matching refspec :
and a pattern with a *; and each branch by the name git resolves,
refs/heads/main and heads/main both being main, and @ alone being HEAD.
git reads heads/X after the colon as X only where the remote has a branch
X, and makes a branch named heads/X where it has none. This module cannot
see the remote's branches and reads heads/X as X wherever it stands: that
is exact for the default branch and board, which are always there, and a
name the remote lacks becomes heads/X, a branch no rule names, so the
module at worst refuses a push git would have let make one, as
HEAD:heads/claude/03. What a command hands to another shell or command as
text, as bash -c 'git push ...', eval and env -S do, is one word to this
module and passes, as do a wrapper not named here (sudo, xargs), a git
alias for push, and a push git's configuration sends where its words do
not say. With push.default=upstream, or its old name tracking, git 2.43
sends a branch named alone, as in "git push origin claude/7" and "git
push -u origin claude/7", and the current branch on a bare "git push", to
the branch it tracks: a claim branch made with "git switch -c claude/7
origin/main", which tracks main, went to main on each of the three, where
with --no-track the first push made claude/7. A remote's push refspecs
(remote.<name>.push) send a push elsewhere too. This module reads no
configuration.

shlex reads a newline as whitespace, which would glue a line onto the one
before it, so a small pass runs first (plain_text): it turns each unquoted
newline into the separator the shell reads it as, ends a comment at its
newline, and removes a backslash-newline, the shell's line continuation.
It tracks single quotes, double quotes and the backslash, and nothing else
of the shell: the quoting inside a command substitution is read as the
quoting around it, and bash's $'...' as a $ and a quoted span; so since
F24's fix each substitution's text is read apart as well (substituted,
below). bash runs
a command text one complete command at a time, so a quote that never
closes stops the line it opens on and what follows, and the commands
before it run; and it reads a here-document's body as text, whose quotes
it does not read. Until F25's fix this module read a command whole or not
at all: a quote that never closed hid every push in the command, those
bash ran before it among them, and an apostrophe in a body opened a quote
bash never opens, which one in a later body could close around a push, as
in the shape a session writes most, a commit message by here-document, a
push, then a pull request's body by another. So the hook reads a command
more than one way and judges every push any reading finds (readings,
placed_commands): whole, as before, with a quote that never closes read as
a character of its word, so the text on either side of it is read as
commands (plain_text, lenient), which reads too much of a line bash
refuses whole and never too little; and, where the command holds
here-documents this module tells (here_document_bodies), with their bodies
cut out, but for the command substitutions of a body the shell expands,
which it runs. The whole reading still reads each body as commands: a body
line that starts a push to main is refused, and the person rephrases it or
puts the text in a file, and a cd in a body moves the shell as this module
reads it, so a push after the body is judged also where the command
starts, as if no move ran (push_places), where the second reading judges
it too. Cutting bodies out in place of reading them was tried once and
dropped: telling a here-document from an arithmetic shift, a quoted marker
or an opener inside a substitution takes more of the shell than this hook
can read, and each misreading cut real commands out of sight. As a second
reading beside the whole, a body misread hides no command the whole
reading shows, and refuses too much at worst. The bodies told are those of
<< and <<- outside quotes and in a substitution, in double quotes or not,
as in "$(cat <<'EOF' ... )", each starting at the first newline at its
operator's level, or at the level around it where the substitution or
the double quotes it stands in close first, as in x=$(cat <<'EOF') (leave),
and ending past the line that is its word, a line of a body the shell
expands joined to the next where it ends in a backslash (continues),
where bash 5.2 ends one in a substitution (closes_substitution), or at
the end of the text; a <<< here-string, arithmetic, a comment and a
quoted span open none, a (( is arithmetic only where bash reads it so,
its parentheses counted past quotes (arithmetic_end), ((cd x); ...) being
a subshell in a subshell, and a case pattern's ) closes no substitution
(case_step), nor does one inside a parameter expansion, ${y:-)}, or a
backquoted span, which bash reads whole and whose here-documents lie
inside it (expansion_step, backquoted). What the shell runs of a body it
expands, its substitutions, is read as bash reads it, the bodies of its
own here-documents cut out in turn (substitutions_in), down to
MAX_NESTING, past which the command is refused unread (TOO_DEEP). Claude
Code reads a hook that runs out of time as no objection and runs the
command, so the reading is built to take a time in proportion to the
text: the scan matches each ( once (matching_parenthesis, scan), a cd
joins no path longer than the system takes (PATH_MAX) and a pushd stacks
in the same time at any depth (stacked); shlex takes a time in the square
of a word's length, so a command longer than MAX_COMMAND is refused
unread (TOO_LONG); and a command the guard still takes longer than
DEADLINE_SECONDS over, reading it and judging its pushes, git's answers
included, for a shape no test has timed, is refused too (TOO_SLOW),
never passed.
A third reading, of each line alone, was weighed
and left out: with a quote that never closes read leniently it finds no
push in F25's shapes that the two miss, and what it alone would read is
text inside quotes that close, as a commit message given by -m "...",
which it would refuse wherever a line starts with a push; what hides a
push inside quotes that close is the quoting of a command substitution or
$'...', which want readings of their own. A backquoted span is read
whole in the lenient readings, as one part of its word (backquoted_word),
so a quote inside one pairs with nothing outside it (F25's fourth
review). And bash runs the text of every command substitution, $( ) or a
backquoted span, wherever it expands one, in double quotes, a parameter
expansion and arithmetic too, with quoting of its own, and the text of a
process substitution, <( ) or >( ), outside double quotes, where shlex
reads <( as a redirection that takes the next word: until F24's fix
out="$(git push ... 2>&1)" and cat <(git push ...)
passed. So the text of each substitution bash runs is read apart, as the
commands of a subshell after the reading, those nested in it inside the
same subshell after its own text, a backquoted span's with the
backslashes bash takes off taken off (substitutions, substituted), from
the command with its here-documents' bodies cut out, so a quoted body in
a substitution, a commit message's, stays text, as F25's fix made it. A
substitution is judged where the shell stands after the whole reading,
and, after a move, where the command starts, as any push after a move
is, so a cd after it in the command may judge it in a clone it does not
run in, which refuses too much at worst. The scan steps over a $'...'
whole with its escapes where bash reads commands (ansi_c_end), so one in
a substitution hides nothing after it. What this leaves: a push inside
$'...', or after one that holds a backslash before an apostrophe and
stands in no substitution, which this module reads as a quote closed
early, still passes; the whole
reading still reads each body as commands with an ordinary line's
quoting, so a body line that holds a double quote before a substitution
naming a push may be refused, as before the fix; a substitution's own
text is made plain as any text is, so a push named inside a $'...' that
holds an escaped apostrophe, in a substitution, may be refused; and a
substitution in a here-document's delimiter word, which bash reads as
text, is read as commands, refusing too much. Branch protection stands behind each.
