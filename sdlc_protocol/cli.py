         with --registry DIR
  workers check, list, describe, get or from-form: the registry of

         runs as a script of its own)

The exit codes are the old tools' too: 0 when done, 1 for a failure told
in one line on stderr (or, for check, the problems on stdout), 2 for a
push the guard refuses or arguments that cannot be read.
