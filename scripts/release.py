"""Which versions main carries that have no tag yet, for the release workflow.

A release of the library is the version in sdlc_protocol/__init__.py.
.github/workflows/release.yml tags each version at the first commit of
main's first-parent line that carries it, the merge of the pull request
that raised it, as v0.2.0 was tagged by hand, and publishes a GitHub
release for the tag once the owner approves the run, so nobody has to
remember to and the workflow releases nothing without that approval
(README.md, Releases, says what else could). This script
says what to tag: walking that line from the newest commit back until a
version that has a tag, where the releases already made begin, every
version met on the way, at the oldest commit that carries it. A release a
run missed, in a burst of merges or a failed run, is made by the next one,
and a tag that exists is never moved, wherever it points. It also writes
what the run's summary tells the owner before the approval: the releases
the run would make, or that there is none to make.

Where a tag stands is checked here too, for release.yml's plan and for the
sync (scripts/sync.py): a tag stands only at a commit of main's first-parent
line that raised it to the tag's version, the commit that carries the
version while its first parent does not, which is where missing() always
puts one. A tag anywhere else, made by hand or moved after its release, is
someone else's, and neither workflow releases or carries it.

  missing    one line per tag to make, oldest first: "<tag> <commit>"
  version    the version the checkout carries, as the workflow names it
  check-tag  nothing when a commit is where the tag stands; else why not,
             on one line, and exit 1
  summary    the summary's words for the lines "<tag> <commit>" on stdin,
             each followed by "tagged" for a tag made before the run
