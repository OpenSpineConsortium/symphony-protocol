# the package is vendored into other repositories' trees, whose own checks
# take only ASCII with LF endings, so a stray byte here breaks every
# consumer's next sync. Then ECOSYSTEM.md, the map of the library and its
# consumers, which must be what scripts/architecture.py draws from
# ecosystem.json and the package today. Then the lessons' shape and
# notebooks. Then the whole test suite, which
# the consumers trust in place of their own tests of these rules.
